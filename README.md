## TF 2 Fast Neural Style Transfer (feed-forward method)

This repo contains a _relatively_ concise TensorFlow 2.6+ implementation of the original feed-forward NST paper (:link: [Johnson et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155.pdf)).
The approach is almost entirely inspired by the **excellent** PyTorch repository (:link: [gordicaleksa](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-neural-style-transfer-johnson)) with some key differences.
